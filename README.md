## Description

I've created a Porfolio to enhance lesson learned throughout the course to practice and show off my web development abilities; particularly in creating a website that displays some information about me, as well as my LinkedIn and Github profile, and a pdf of my resume.

## Instruction

The user must create a basic repository including gitignore "node_modules" and license "MIT" from Github. The project has separate files, and the navbar at the top of the screen allows for navigating among different files.
